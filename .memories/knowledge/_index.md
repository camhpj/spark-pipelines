# Knowledge Index

This folder stores verified, durable facts about the repository. Each file should contain facts only (no plans or opinions). If a fact is time-sensitive, annotate it with "Verified on YYYY-MM-DD".

Existing knowledge files:
- architecture.md (compiler flow, artifact generation, metadata handling)
- build-and-dev.md (uv/Taskfile workflows and standard commands)
- cli-and-runtime.md (CLI commands and runtime entrypoint status)
- documentation.md (hand-written docs location and indexing)
- dependencies.md (runtime and dev dependency pins/ranges)
- features-and-registry.md (feature interface, registry, built-ins)
- outputs-and-layout.md (artifact layout and naming)
- pipeline-spec.md (current YAML schema as implemented)
- profiling-notebook.md (profiling notebook generation behavior)
- semantic-contract.md (required canonical columns)
- testing.md (current tests and tooling)
