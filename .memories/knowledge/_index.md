# Knowledge Index

This folder stores verified, durable facts about the repository. Each file should contain facts only (no plans or opinions). If a fact is time-sensitive, annotate it with "Verified on YYYY-MM-DD".

Suggested knowledge topics to add when enough verified content exists:
- architecture.md (compiler flow, artifact generation, runtime integration)
- domain-contract.md (canonical entities, semantic contract, mapping spec)
- pipeline-spec.md (pipeline YAML schema and validation policies)
- features-and-registry.md (feature types, FeatureAssets, join semantics)
- outputs-and-layout.md (out_dir structure, SQLMesh config, rendered SQL)
- profiling-notebook.md (notebook format and profiling steps)
- testing.md (test tiers, golden SQL guidance)
- build-and-dev.md (uv/Taskfile workflows, local commands)
- dependencies.md (key runtime deps and purpose)
