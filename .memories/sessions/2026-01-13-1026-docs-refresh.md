## Summary
Added a hand-written documentation set under `docs/`, wired it into `README.md`, and corrected a pipeline example mismatch. Expanded the feature guide with a concrete implementation checklist so contributors know how to add new features safely.

## What Changed
- Added new documentation files under `docs/` (overview, architecture, pipeline, mapping, profiling, features, runtime, testing, troubleshooting, API reference).
- Updated `README.md` with a documentation index and expanded the internal conventions section.
- Adjusted pipeline example inputs (age feature uses `as_of_date`) and documented feature ordering expectations.
- Added a feature implementation checklist and common pitfalls to `docs/features.md`.

## Why
The project needed comprehensive hand-written guides tailored to developers, data scientists, and data engineers, plus clearer internal conventions and accurate examples aligned with current behavior.

## Decisions
- Focused on hand-written Markdown docs only (no autogenerated API tooling).
- Documented internal conventions directly in `README.md` as the canonical entrypoint.

## Next Steps
- Review the guides for tone/coverage and request additions if anything is missing.
- Add a glossary or semantic contract guide if readers need more domain context.
- Expand examples with a feature + join model walkthrough if desired.
